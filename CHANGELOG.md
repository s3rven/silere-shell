# Changelog

Only work since the latest release is listed here. Completed notes move to
[`docs/releases`](docs/releases/) and stay linked at the bottom of this file.

Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with entries
grouped by the part of the shell they touch once a section runs long. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) loosely while in `0.x`: minor versions
change features, patch versions fix them. The updater follows signed stable tags; the
settings file carries its own `__version` and migrates separately.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Log out in the power menu, confirmed with a second press like Reboot and Power off.

### Changed

- Album art on the Home page crossfades to the next cover without dimming halfway through.
- `silere` and `silere doctor` color their status words in a terminal, using its own palette; `NO_COLOR` turns this off, as it now does for the installer.

### Fixed

- Scrolling over a tray icon with a touchpad sends the app whole steps instead of one per touchpad event.
- Opening or closing a tray submenu tells the app once, not twice.
- Notifications sent with `notify-send -i` show their icon instead of a letter, whether the icon is a theme name or a file in the system icon folders.
- `silere log` prints plain text when piped or saved to a file, without terminal color codes.
- Run from a terminal, `silere doctor` reads the Quickshell version instead of warning it could not, and `silere update` no longer refuses a release because of it.
