# Changelog

Only work since the latest release is listed here. Completed notes move to
[`docs/releases`](docs/releases/) and stay linked at the bottom of this file.

Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with entries
grouped by the part of the shell they touch once a section runs long. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) loosely while in `0.x`: minor versions
change features, patch versions fix them. The updater follows signed stable tags; the
settings file carries its own `__version` and migrates separately.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Smooth the reactive underline's glow shoulders with bounded, alpha-preserving
  gradient stops and derive all its colors from one theme-aware fade.

- Share device-pixel stroke sizing between control outlines, dividers, glow rims,
  and notification countdowns; floating glow rims now keep a consistent thickness
  on fractional scales and clamp their corners to the available space.
- Use one wheel-gesture cleanup timer instead of creating a timer for each control.

### Fixed

- Keep notification, network, and screenshot glow envelopes independent, so
  overlapping events and individual toggles cannot reset one another's geometry.
  Critical notification flashes retain their semantic color during screenshots.

- Catch the first network disconnect after a connected startup, clear every network
  glow animation when motion stops, and skip reconnect fades when the glow is dark.
- Reset expired wheel gestures before accepting new input, even if the event loop
  has delayed cleanup; keep gesture keys independent of JavaScript object names.
