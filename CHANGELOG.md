# Changelog

Only work since the latest release is listed here. Completed notes move to
[`docs/releases`](docs/releases/) and stay linked at the bottom of this file.

Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with entries
grouped by the part of the shell they touch once a section runs long. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) loosely while in `0.x`: minor versions
change features, patch versions fix them. The updater follows signed stable tags; the
settings file carries its own `__version` and migrates separately.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A notification still sliding out when a newer one took the last visible place no longer disappears mid-exit and comes back later.
- The calendar takes keyboard focus the first time it opens, so Tab and the arrow keys work without a click.
- The whole height of the bar opens the calendar from the clock, like every other widget.
- `silere update --rollback` still works after the release it undoes was withdrawn upstream and a later check removed its tag.
- A shell that does not run as a service keeps its rollback until the updated shell is seen running, instead of losing it to the next daily check.
- An update stops instead of replacing an ignored file in the checkout, such as settings or notification history, if a release ever ships a file at the same path.
- Recovery from a silent Hyprland event socket restarts the service only while it is still running.
- Installing an update right after changing a setting no longer fails with "Settings could not be saved before the update" while the settings file is being read back.
- `silere reset` no longer starts a shell that was not running, or stops one it cannot bring back, because a service for the checkout is installed but stopped and disabled.
- An update keeps its rollback until this checkout's shell is seen running, even while a service for another checkout is up.
